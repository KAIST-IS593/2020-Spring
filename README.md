## Course Description
This course teaches a series of topics to build safe software systems based on programming language theories and techniques. The course covers formal semantics of programming languages and state-of-the-art techniques to formally estimate software behavior to prevent security vulnerabilities beforehand. In addition, the course introduces new waves in language-based security, thereby encouraging students to imagine and realize secure and reliable programming systems.

## Grading
- Homework: 50%
- Project: 30%
- Midterm: 0% (due to the COVID-19 outbreak)
- Final: 20%

## Textbook
- Lecture slides will be provided
- Xavier Rival and Kwangkeun Yi, [Introduction to Static Analysis: an Abstract Interpretation Perspective](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-static-analysis), MIT Press, 2020

## Homework
This course includes programming assignments through which students will learn how to design
and implement program analyzers.
We will use Github/Github Classroom to provide skeleton code and manage submissions.
Make sure you have a Github account and get the [student developer pack benefits](https://education.github.com/pack).
Moreover, student should get familiar with `git`.
If you are new to `git`, see this [book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
Students will use the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) programming language for the assignments.

All submissions will be managed using Github.
For each assignment, a unique invitation URL for Github Classroom will be posted at [KLMS](http://klms.kaist.ac.kr).
Once you accept the invitation, a private repository for your assignment will be created.
You can push as many commits as you want before the deadline. We will grade the final commit of your `master` branch.

The late homework policy is as follows:
- 80% credit for one day late
- 50% credit for two days late
- NO credit given after two days late


## Project
Students will propose their own project topics in the middle of the semester
and present their final results at the end. See the [guidelines](slides/project.pdf) for the details.
Here are a selected list of research papers that use static analysis for interesting problems in different area:
- Security
  - [Airbus Controller SW Verification](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/781131.781153)

This [tool](https://github.com/travitch/whole-program-llvm) will be useful when you run your LLVM analyzer
for realword programs.
