## Course Description
This course teaches a series of topics to build safe software systems based on programming language theories and techniques. The course covers formal semantics of programming languages and state-of-the-art techniques to formally estimate software behavior to prevent security vulnerabilities beforehand. In addition, the course introduces new waves in language-based security, thereby encouraging students to imagine and realize secure and reliable programming systems.
