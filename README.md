# IS593: Language-based Security

## Notice for Fall 2023
This course is designed for an alternative to [CS524](https://github.com/prosyslab-classroom/cs524-program-analysis) for the Graduate School of
Information Security of KAIST. The course contents will be largely the same as CS524. Thus, if you plan to take CS524, I recommend you take IS593 in  Fall 2023.

## Course Webpage
We will use the [CS524](https://github.com/prosyslab-classroom/cs524-program-analysis) webpage for this semester.
